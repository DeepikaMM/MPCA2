Assignment 02
Q:
In the file hw2.s,  write ARM assembly code for a function findMax that
takes a single argument (n) and returns a single value (the maximum value f(j) of the function).
 code should assume that the function f() has already been written, and that it obeys all the
calling conventions we have discussed in class. code should also obey all these calling
conventions, and should call f(i) for 0  i  n – 1 ONLY.
